        <p>Hi there!</p>

        <p>I'm Patricio, information systems engineer and senior software developer. I love open data, civic technologies, and I'm openly against the Silicon Valley culture of exponential growth and 10x engineers.</p>

        <p>When not in the computer I'm usually relaxing at home, hiking or taking some pictures.</p>

        <p>The modern web is completely over-engineered, a dumb race to create and use over-engineered tools and frameworks to solve simple tasks, like a blog. I want this to be a place where I don't feel overwhelmed by thousands of injected lines of code.</p>

        <p>The goal of this website is to have a showcase of work and ideas, easy to share and to update. Something minimal that I can evolve in time and it is not tide to a specifict tool.</p>
