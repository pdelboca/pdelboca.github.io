greetings!

Thanks for passing by!

My name is Patricio Del Boca, I'm an Information Systems Engineer and Open Activist. This is my personal site where I document my thoughts, feelings and projects. This web is my little corner in the internet that I have been happily cultivating since 2016. It started as a blog in R to publish random analysis on interesting open datasets, but currently it is mostly writings about open source, open government, web development and technology.
