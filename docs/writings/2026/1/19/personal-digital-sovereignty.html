    <h1>Personal Digital Sovereignty: How I'm moving out of Big Tech.</h1>
    <h5><i>January 19, 2026</i></h5>
    <div>
        <p>I'm happy to see the trend of moving out of Big Tech to more open and sovereign solutions. Personally, I could share that it is not as difficult as people might think. Some of my experience:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>For my phone</strong>: almost 4 years ago I bought a <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/">Fairphone</a> with <a href="https://e.foundation/e-os/">/e/OS</a> (a de-googled Android) and I'm more than happy with the choice. The only big difference I noticed is the amount of tracking that it blocks by default (one app tried to track more than 100 times per day!) For the rest, everything works as a normal phone.</li>
<li><strong>For my email</strong>: I have moved to <a href="https://proton.me/">Proton</a> almost a year ago. It doesn't need to be an all-in change. I have slowly moved everything and I am more than happy with all the products (VPN and Password Managers are great!). I have only a couple of spreadsheets in my Google account and some subscriptions but my usage of GMail has decreased drastically. It's not my default anymore. I'll probably ditch it completely this year.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Computer</strong>: A Lenovo with <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. I have been using GNU/Linux as my main OS since I was a teenager. Now, it's been 7 years since I do not own a Windows machine (I use to have dual boot for gaming, but not anymore). My mom has been using Ubuntu since 15 years ago, her laptop has been 100% Linux and she never even noticed any difference.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media</strong>: I no longer use Twitter, I haven't open Instagram in almost 3 years. I still use LinkedIn of course. I don't miss Twitter at all, Instagram a little bit (but it was really bad for my mental health). I use Bluesky with a very limited timeline and RSS a lot.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this helps anyone thinking about doing a move to more ethical tech! Happy to answer any more questions.</p>
