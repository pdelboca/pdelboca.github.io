        <h1>Good-bye Ubuntu: Wellcome Debian!</h1>
        <h3><i>Changing to a more robust OS after 15 years.</i></h3>
        <h5>2023-07-17</h5>
        <p>I have been an Ubuntu user since they shipped a CD with <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn">Feisty Fawn</a> to my house. I was introduced to it by my brother and I still remember
            the sensation of freedom when I installed it for the first time. The feeling I got when I opened for the first time the Software Center and I saw hundreds
            of free and open source software will that I could easily install without cracking will remain in me. That feeling of freedom will mark me forever and 
            will define my future career as an Information System Engineer.</p>

        <p>Now, after a couple of rough years fighting with unstable updates, buggy frontend and a horrible experiences with snap I decided to move to Debian.</p>

        <p>Debian 12 surprised me with how easy and straightforward was to install it. Also, it is great that it comes with Python 3.11. For my surprise I didn't have 
         any issue at all with firmawares for my Thinkpad T14. I did found a bug after installing it from the LiveCD, but it was easily fixed following some advice 
         from the awesome community. Link to it just in case you're struggling with the same: <a href="https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?p=774204#p774204">
            Errors while updating system or install new packages Debian 12 (Solved sort of)</a></p>
        
        <p>I always wanted to be a user of Debian, now after a smooth install I'm ready for it. I'm also eager to start contributing to it and why not, became a package
            maintainer.</p>

        <p>To Ubuntu, I wish you all the best. I will allways have a special place for you in my heart.</p>
