    <h1>on ai, democracy and wikipedia</h1>
    <h3><i>Let's not blame AI for the lack of critical thinking in our society.</i></h3>
    <h5>2023-08-21</h5>
    <p>Lately I ran across this great article <a
        href="https://medium.com/the-conversation/how-ai-could-take-over-elections-and-undermine-democracy-83a923b54b4a">How
        AI could take over elections - and undermine democracy</a>. The article opens with the following question: <strong>Could
      organizations use artificial intelligence language models such as ChatGPT to induce voters to behave in specific
      ways?</strong> and follows the question with on a concrete example of a tool that could be used to achieve one goal: to change people's
      voting behavior.</p>

    <p>Even when I agree with the possibility of the scenario, the question will keep reappearing with every new
      technological development. <mark>The ability to undermine democracy is not an attribute of the Artificial
        Intelligence itself</mark>, we are going to be forced to make that question for each new technology (as we did in
      the past): </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Could organizations use <b>radio</b> to induce voters to behave in specific ways?</li>
      <li>Could organizations use <b>newspapers</b> to induce voters to behave in specific ways?</li>
      <li>Could organizations use <b>television</b> to induce voters to behave in specific ways?</li>
      <li>Could organizations use <b>social</b> media to induce voters to behave in specific ways?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The question was, and will be, always the same and the answer is always the same: Yes. But that's only because
      the <mark>thing in the questions with the ability to undermine democracy is not the tool, but the organization</mark>.</p>

    <p>
      So the bottom line is what can we do to counteract the capacities that every new technology provides to undermine
      democracy. A common denominator can be extracted: education, critical thinking and fact checking. In a world where
      new technologies are constantly pushing the boundaries of how much content can be created, two questions became
      even more critical:
    <ul>
      <li>“Where did you get this information?” </li>
      <li>“Have you double checked its veracity?”</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In a world characterised by overabundance of information, Wikipedia still remains a good source of Open
      Knowledge that has these two questions embedded in its design. <mark>Wikipedia, by design, promotes the critical thinking
      of its users</mark>. Even more, since it is a collaborative effort, it enforces critical thinking and healthy debate
      among its content editors: <mark>“Cite required” is a core element of Wikipedia design that allows people to challenge a
      narrative and, on the other side, forces them to provide facts and data about any claims.</mark></p>

    <p>In a world where we are gonna be challenged to double check everything we see online, it is a blessing for us to have a tool like Wikipedia.</p>
